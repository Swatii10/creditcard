Credit Card Anomaly Detection
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect anomalous credit card transactions, aiming to identify fraudulent behavior with high accuracy and interpretability.
üîç Highlights:
- Clustering with DBSCAN for identifying dense regions and outliers in transaction patterns
- Silhouette Score used to evaluate clustering quality and structure
- Logistic Regression applied for classification of transactions as normal or anomalous
- Evaluation through key classification metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
üõ† Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

Want to add a summary of your dataset or show model performance with visuals or charts? I can help shape that too.
